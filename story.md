I started at the track ready to set off for this vast and long race . As I looked at the other contestants we wished each other good luck . We went zooming off like thunder. I was moving forward with increasing speed. I was in the lead when I came across my first obstacle which was a huge limbo pole. I went across it as if I'm crawling under a thin pole. I was in the lead when I stumbled across a wild bear. It caught sight of me and we looked each other in the eye directly. My speed decreased for about 30 min. Then he started chasing me towards me, I ran  as fast as possible. I felt like I was going to die when I found a banana. I ate it and it gave me super strength. I knew I was already delayed and I'm in last place. The time was already 30 min in. I found a grape, I wondered what it was. I ate it. It gave me speed. I ran  as fast as possible. I went zooming even quicker than a cheetah . I was Moving forward with an increasing speed. My speed just increased. I saw My rival Almost at the Finnish line but then I Zoomed past him and got first place .
